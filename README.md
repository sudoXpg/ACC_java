# Advanced Competitive Coding

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed as part of the **Advanced Competitive Coding** course. The programs focus on solving a variety of algorithmic problems and challenges commonly found in competitive programming. The key areas covered include:

- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Efficient algorithms such as Karatsuba multiplication for fast arithmetic operations.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions involving optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, including the maximum product subarray and similar problems.
- **String Manipulation**: Algorithms to find special strings, such as lexicographically smallest palindromes and binary palindromes.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Implementations of classic algorithms like Euclid’s algorithm and Booth’s algorithm for advanced number theory and pattern matching problems.
- **Array-Based Challenges**: Solutions focusing on subarray problems, equilibrium points, hourglass problems, and leader elements in arrays.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Programs that manipulate binary numbers, including swap nibble operations and flipping bits for optimization.

Each program is designed to enhance problem-solving skills in competitive coding, focusing on time and space complexity optimization.
